      <p>
      A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and on.
      </p>
      <p>
      Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: "You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
      Knight turned the machine off and on.
      </p>
      <p>
      The machine worked.
      </p>

      <h2 style="border-color:#794DE8;">Your Family is Dead. We are Your New Mother.</h2>
      <p>We take people off the streets and turn them into professional software developers. We don't know how or why we do it. We just follow UNIX conventions.</p>
      <p>Are you a street urchin looking for a better way of life? Come <a href="academy.html" style="border-color: #4583E8;">Join the Arcanium</a> and we'll turn you into a wizard in no time.</p>
