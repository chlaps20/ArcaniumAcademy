      A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and on.
      </p>
      <p>
      Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: "You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
      Knight turned the machine off and on.
      </p>

      The machine worked.
