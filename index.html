			<h2>Software Development can be Magical</h2>
			<p>
				Becoming an expert developer is hard enough. Why make it boring?
			</p>
			<p>
				The Arcanium is a UNIX based software development guild. We believe that the principles handed down
				by developers of olde are still relevant to modern software development. Not only that, studying these ancient lessons can lead to a rewarding, zen software development experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are adepts of a long line of wizards who transmit arcane knowledge of all things command line down to us from a higher age.
				Every day we seek out new spells and incantations, acquire tomes of arcane knowledge, and undergo lengthy quests for glory and fame.
			</p>
			<p>
				We value teamwork for the sake of learning. We value learning for the sake of learning. Also, we're happy to help you build your thingy because wizards need to eat.
